# ᵔᴥᵔ Zsh - Runtime configuration

> I'm using the "Oh-My-Zsh" environment ʘ‿ʘ

Please note that my .zshrc is not really useful for a bare zSH installation, I require and rely heavily on the zSH environment called Oh-My-Zsh. That said, if you are going for Zsh on your workstation I don't see any reason not to use Oh-My-Zsh as it's aimed and optimised for developers and devops!

This is not a installation guide per-se but more a list of all the items that build up my Oh-My-Zsh / zshrc configuration. I will try to include some quick and dirty install commands for you to copy paste so you don't have to grind the internet for answers.

Here is a quick screenshot of my terminal so you can see what it looks like.
