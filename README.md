dotrc - Runtime configurations
==============================

These are my Runtime configuration settings for various applications/shell interpreters.
If you need help to install or use some of the dot rc files, just write a note/comment and i will get back to you.

I will try to descripe how i installed the different things, however i will also expect that you yourself know how to work on a Linux/Unix system.
I have split it up into two main folders, but you will in somecases find much the same files as well it's all build on good'ol Unix and the structure is the same in many cases. However there might be small tweaks so please try to find your dotrc file in the right main folder to begin with then perhaps check the other.

Overview
--------

	Linux  - All my dotrc files for Linux. These are used on servers, workstations and embedded systems

	MacOS  - Since i use MacOS on my workstation i only think it's fair to share those as well.


Contributing
------------

You can always contact me, to either get direct access to contribute (friends only) or just send me changes/addons and i will make the nessesary changes.
You should know that most of these rc files are my own prefered settings, so most changes and corrections applied to this github repo is only something that would reflect things i like but i strive to make it usefull for anyone.
