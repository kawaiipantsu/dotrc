Here you can see the "typically" git info you would expect ...

This is my primary bash prompt that i use on almost all of my Linux devices. It's mostly implemented on servers or other embedded devices. On my clients i usually run something like zsh. But as a rule of thumb, if it's rocking bash this is my prompt.

## DNBash

I have always liked the idea of a clean simple Linux / UNIX prompt. Right ? But also i don't want it to be to simple, it's a total dilemma! So I always end up floating around in that dead space where my prompt either feels to simple or that it feels like it do to much and slows me down. This is where I have ended, I like this prompt on my servers. It’s quick and sleek, yet gives me lot of information without really using to many external scripts or programs.

### Basically you can break my prompt down to the following things
  * Server hostname (short name)
  * Clock with seconds (sometimes I seconds yes ...)
  * Username
  * Command line history recall number for current command
  * Quick telling you how many files and total size of the path your in
  * My "Error face" it's showing return codes (I use them a lot in scripts to tell what happened)
  * (new line) - Yes I have a dual line prompt, either you hate it or you love it !
  * Current path (pwd)
  * Git info (if inside git project) (also toggles itself off if git is not installed)
  * Prompt type $ <> # (Rocking it old school, why not!)
